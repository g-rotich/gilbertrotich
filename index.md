## About Me {#about}

I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of South Florida, specializing in computer vision and self-supervised learning, with additional focus on generative and multimodal foundation models that integrate NLP. My research centers on unsupervised learning across multiple levels of representation, aiming to build richer, more scalable visual understanding—particularly by leveraging language signals during pre-training.

Interests include computer vision, multimodal self-supervised learning, hierarchical representation learning, NLP, and Earth observation.
